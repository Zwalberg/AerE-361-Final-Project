Problem Statement
One problem among children and adults is they are not proficient in mental math. Mental math is doing arithmetic using only the brain. Mental math doesn't include a pencil and paper, a calculator, or counting fingers. This skill seems to be a dying art, as more children and adults require a calculator to do even the most simple calculations, like addition and subtraction. 
A way to practice this skill while also having fun could be the key to incentivizing all ages to practice this skill. According to EurekAlert!, one effect of practicing mental math includes bettering emotional health, which can help with depression and anxiety.

When mental math is a practiced skill, there is greater satisfaction when solving simple math calculations, and time is saved from not having to pull a calculator out. 
Moreover, sharpening mental capacity is a goal for many people. One way to sharpen mental capacity is by holding a value in memory and applying basic math operations. Repeating this process not only enhances mental math, but is a great way to “delay memory decline and fight dementia, Alzheimer’s, and other senility-related problems” (Turner, 2019).
As can be seen, mental math can have enormously positive effects on the health of your brain. 

In addition, “the most common cause of mental decline is boredom, routine, and lack of challenging activities to do” (Turner, 2019). To combat boredom, we want to devise a way to integrate practicing mental math with a stimulating game. A fun game will entice a player to play while disguising that the player is practicing their mental math skills. 

Another area that can be addressed is creating a game requiring only one player. There is simplicity in playing a game against yourself. That's why games such as Solitaire have endured for decades and are still popular to this day. Tweaking this idea a bit, we can create a game that plays against the computer, so there is no need for another player. 
Overall, we want to find a solution to enhance people's mental math capacity while allowing them to have fun while doing it. Studies show that practicing a skill using a game is more effective because “fun motivates students and helps them pay attention and stay focused on the subject”(Why use games to teach? 2018). Taking all of this into consideration, we intend to create a Blackjack game with a card counter that can be displayed by user request.
