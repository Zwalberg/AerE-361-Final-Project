# AerE 361 Final Project Repository - Group 10 Fall 2022

Welcome to Team 10's final project for Iowa State University's AER E 361 course!

The team decided to create a virtual Blackjack game and pair it with a card counting system. This repository includes the C code and Arduino code to run the Blackjack game as well as the documentation for designing and playing the game.

This 6 person team was split into two smaller subteams in order to maximize efficiency. The two teams can be seen below.

## Software Team:
- Nicholas Johnson
- Clayton McPhail
- Zachery Walberg

The software team was primarily in charge of writing and debugging the C code for the game.

## Hardware Team:
- Samuel Cvikota
- Victoria Fleming
- Jessica Melville

The hardware team was primarily in charge of setting up all of the physical controls for the game as well as integrating the C code with Arduino.
